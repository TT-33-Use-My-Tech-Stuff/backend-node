## ‚òùÔ∏è**Pitch**

Use My Tech Stuff: like AirBnB, but for high end electronics. Are you tired of paying ridiculous fees for camera and other equipment rentals? Bypass the middleman and rent from a real person!

## ‚úÖ **MVP**

1. Two user types: `owner`s and `renter`

2. `user` can login and create a profile

3. `user` can then setup items they have `for rent` such as cameras, TV's, party equipment such as speakers/fog machines, etc.

4. `user` will be able to create, read, update and delete rental data. A second `user` can login and see `items` that users have `for rent` and ask to `rent` an `item`

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è**Stretch**

1. Add a payment option into the application allowing a `user` to pay over Paypal / Stripe etc. to `rent` their `item`s

2. Be able to schedule a `time` and `place` for pick-up

3. Add a `review` system into the app so that the social aspect is there to ensure that `user`s are legitimate.

//TODO//

- [ ] fix frontend DELETE bug w/Paul
- [ ] add endpoints and models to filter out renters and find all the tech a renter has for rent (join statement in model?)
- [ ] build tests for user routes
- [ ] build tests for tech routes
- [ ] build tests for user models
- [ ] build tests for tech models
- [ ] build tests for middleware
- [ ] make a conditional so that a user can log in with either their username or email
